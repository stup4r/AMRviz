# AMRviz

An interactive visualization of the antimicrobial resistance evolution from 2001 to 2016 in different European countries.
The visualization is still in progress (missing data is not clearly stated).

Selecting a country will bring up a spider plot (radar chart) with different bacteria-antibiotic combinations in time.
The user can move the slider on the bottom of the page, or simply plot all years at once. There are checkboxes in the legend, where specific years may be selected (or deselected) for comparison. The values in tooltips show the percentage of resistant AND intermediate strains found in that particular year, for that particular bactera-antibiotic pair.
